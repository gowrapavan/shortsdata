You can’t make 10 changes, essentially playing our backup team, and expect to get a result against a team who are 3rd in the Bundesliga and have 4 or 5 players who won it only 2 seasons ago. That being said the players need to take responsibility too, Savinho and Bobb aren’t productive enough, Ait-Nouri looks a bit lost at the back, Trafford isn’t UCL quality in my opinion. Overall it was the worst we’ve played this season by far, absolutely abysmal going forward and it was way too easy for them to bypass our midfield. Hopefully a better performance vs Leeds on Saturday",

We just defeated Barcelona 3-0, it's maybe just a regular UCL match worth the same as Quarabag. But Chelsea fans, this is the turning point. We have Estêvão willian, Palmer, Caicedo, Cucurella, James, Colwill, Fernandez so many other young players with special potential, All below 25. We have Rabbaj, Emeghua, Quenda, Mc-Queen all young players in the ecosystem. This is the time Chelsea fans, OUR CHELSEA IS BACK. We have the quality to win it all once again. Up the Chels.💙🦁⚽🏆💙",

January Window can’t come soon enough. Hopefully Fahey and O’Boyle can work some Beardy and Klopp magic and bring some of the World Class players soon to be available to Anfield. The owners have to invest. Between £10m to £30m should cover us for the next four or five windows at the current rate. YNWA",

Al momento usciti subito dalla CL , con l ' acqua alla gola nella coppetta successiva appena trovato qualcuno che almeno sappia cosa sia il calcio , in campionato ben indietro , avanti così Piovani . La società deve prendere ragazze di qualità vera e mettere in panchina uno/a di caratura internazionale per la prossima stagione , se vuole vincere .",

Arteta not trusting his bench again affect us, I can't blame him bcox of this match but everyone gave their best and the draw looks like losing to them, they feel remorseful for the draw. We can't win every game but we should make sure not to lose, so draw is better😊",
